# NoSurrender_Case

We are trying to stay on the platform. <br> It has a basic structure such as a timer,kickback system and gets a score.<br> 
You must kick the enemies out of the field before the time expires.<br>
There are a lot of things that need to be improved.<br>
Thank you for your time:) <br>
